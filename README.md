MongoDB University 
Courseware and solutions of problems from MongoDB University's classes that I've attended.

This repository is organized into different folders. Each folder represents a class that I've attended at MongoDB University. Each class directory will contain a directory for each week of duration (each one with a different topic) plus one with the final exam and its solution. In each week folder you will find the following:

A zip file with the week's handouts and other courseware material.
A folder for each homework of the week. This folder will contain a README file with the problem statement and, if the solution requires the use of the Mongo shell, a Javascript file with the query used (you can test it by passing the Javascript file as an argument when opening the Mongo shell) or a Shell/Batch script.
You may also find a Batch and a Shell script called setup_db which will import the databases/collections used for the weekly exercises. In order to work, these scripts assumes that you already have a MongoDB instance running on localhost, that you have the MongoDB bin folder on system path and that the handouts zip have been unzipped on the same folder of the script.
